# LetterFrequency
LETTER FREQUENCY Letter Frequency  In these days kids are introduced to computers at a very early age and in some schools the kids are made to practice to type their names using computers. The teachers found it a bit difficult to evaluate their name and they planned to automate this task by writing the program that will display the letter frequencies. Can you please help them out? Write a program to compute the frequency of each lowercase letter in the string and display them in the alphabetical order.    Input and Output Format:  Input consists of a string. Assume that all characters in the string are lowercase letters and the maximum length of the string is 200.  The letters are displayed sorted in ascending order.    Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.    [All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output]  Sample Input 1:  Enter the input string  anitha    Sample Output 1:  The letter frequency is  a 2  h 1  i 1  n 1  t 1
